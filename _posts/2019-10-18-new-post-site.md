I would like to think I have somewhat relavent experience in the sports analytics community. Having been in charge of McMaster Basketball analytics team, I see that there is a different view as a mathmatician and a basketball fan.

Every basketball fan thinks that analytics are framework and justification for their statements the same way a data scientist would snoop for a reduced model just to prove their point.
There are many instagram accounts or twitter accounts with users who have ideas of the game and use stats to support their ideas. 
This is great! We are taught this in school and it is a good use of supporting your thesis.

Cool. Not in sports stats.

This is not what we want. We want to find and optimize trends in data. Much of what a sports statistician should do is with respect to their coaching staff. At the end of the day, they are the ones calling the shots. The role is to aid and to demonstrate why something is the most optimal method and how this can be of benefit to the team. There is not benefit in creating an arguement to have certain players creating certain actions. There is an optimal action by all means but this notion of using stats as attack points is not valid.

This probably could have been a tweet but oh well. It was a very poor explanation because I'm not very good at writing lol.

I would like to think I have somewhat relavent experience in the sports analytics community. Having been in charge of McMaster Basketball analytics team, I see that there is a different view as a mathmatician and a basketball fan.

Every basketball fan thinks that analytics are framework and justification for their statements the same way a data scientist would snoop for a reduced model just to prove their point.

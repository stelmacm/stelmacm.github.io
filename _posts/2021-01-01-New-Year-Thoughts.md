I made a New Years resolution that I will start this blog and posting a solid amount anything I do for fun to explore the world of sports analytics.
I have this terrible thing where I keep track of everything in my head or on a sticky note and that is not efficient. 
Follow me on twitter for more info (I have also made a resolution to tweet more).

I have had this site for about a year now but I was never interested in doing much to it since I didn't like the layout of it.
Over the holiday break, I took to creating an R Blogdown project and creating a website from there. Blogdown is easy to use and quick but ultimately I realized I was just wasting internet space. I decided to come back to this website even though it could use some improving. I think forcing myself to write down how I explore the problems I encounter will be good so others (as if anyone will ever read this) can see the thought process in case they are looking to get into sports statistics.

A problem I have is mathematical notation (via latex) does not show up in markdown, so I need to look into that.
